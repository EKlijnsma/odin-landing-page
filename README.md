Project: Landing Page from The Oding Project Foundations course

This project is intended to apply the basic HTML and CSS knowledge gained during the project in a more 'real-life' situation. 
The Odin Project does not provide all the details, but rather the basic requirements. 
In addition they encourage students (me) to revisit course material and other sources as well as developing the required skill to look online and in documentation.

That being said, I have some knowledge of HTML and CSS from prior course I took, but now I finally dare to tackle The Odin Project. 
The fact that it needs to be done in an own environment, running VS Code locally, installing git and using GitHub, etc. scared me away initially. 

Now I aim to learn especially those things during the Foundations course because the technicalities of HTML CSS and also JavaScript later are not as new to me anymore as they will be to most other students.

So, with that said here is my landing page, with which I pretty much stuck to the requirements and not much else.
